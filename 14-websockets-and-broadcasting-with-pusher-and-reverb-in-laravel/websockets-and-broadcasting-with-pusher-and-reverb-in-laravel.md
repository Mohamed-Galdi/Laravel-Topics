**WebSockets** provide a persistent, bidirectional communication channel between a client (e.g., a browser) and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are stateless and the connection closes after each response, WebSockets maintain an open connection, allowing the server to push data to the client instantly without requiring repeated client requests (polling).

## 1. Drivers: Pusher & Reverb

In a real-time application, we need a way to deliver broadcasted events instantly to connected clients. Laravel doesn’t handle the low-level WebSocket connections itself — instead, it relies on a broadcasting driver to do the heavy lifting. You can choose between self-hosted options like **Reverb** or managed services like **Pusher**, depending on your needs for control, scalability, and maintenance.

- **Pusher**: A third-party service that manages WebSocket connections externally, reducing server load and simplifying setup.
- **Reverb**: Introduced in Laravel 11, Reverb is Laravel's official WebSocket server, running on your infrastructure for greater control and customization.

| Feature      | Pusher                                                                               | Reverb                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**     | Paid third-party service with a free tier (100 connections, 200,000 daily messages). | Free, first-party Laravel WebSocket server.                               |
| **Setup**    | Minimal setup: configure API credentials in `broadcasting.php`.                      | Requires hosting and maintaining a WebSocket server.                      |
| **Cost**     | Subscription-based (see [pusher.com](https://pusher.com/)).                          | No fees; costs tied to your server hosting.                               |
| **Control**  | Limited control; relies on external service.                                         | Full control and customization on your server.                            |
| **Use Case** | Ideal for quick setups or projects without server management resources               | Suits cost-conscious or custom projects with server management capability |

Both drivers integrate with **Laravel Echo**, a JavaScript library that handles client-side channel subscriptions and event listening.

### a. Pusher

By using Pusher, you eliminate the need to manage your own WebSocket server infrastructure, making it an ideal choice for getting started with Laravel broadcasting.

First, you'll need a Pusher account and application:

1. Visit [pusher.com](https://pusher.com/) and create a free account
2. Create a new Channels app from your dashboard
3. Choose your preferred regions and cluster

Once created, you'll have access to your app credentials in the "App Keys" section:

![pusher dashboard](<pusher dashboard screenshot.webp>)

Pusher provides a real-time debug console to monitor your broadcasts:

![pusher debug console](<pusher debbuger console.webp>)

### b. Reverb

**Laravel Reverb** is Laravel's official WebSocket server, introduced to provide a first-party solution for real-time broadcasting. Unlike Pusher (which is a hosted service), Reverb runs on your own servers, giving you complete control over your WebSocket infrastructure while eliminating monthly subscription costs.

Reverb runs as a separate server process alongside your Laravel application:

```bash
# Start Reverb server in foreground (development)
php artisan reverb:start

# Start with debug output
php artisan reverb:start --debug

# Start on specific host and port
php artisan reverb:start --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080
```

In production, use a process manager like Supervisor to keep Reverb running:

```ini
; /etc/supervisor/conf.d/reverb.conf
[program:reverb]
command=php /var/www/html/artisan reverb:start
directory=/var/www/html
user=www-data
autostart=true
autorestart=true
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/var/log/reverb.log
```

## 2. Server-Side Installation

Laravel 11 introduced a more **streamlined** installation approach - instead of including broadcasting and API files by default (which many applications don't need), Laravel now provides an intelligent installation command that sets up only what you actually plan to use.

Laravel gives you **three ways** to set up broadcasting, depending on your needs:

### a. Interactive Installation (Recommended)

```bash
php artisan install:broadcasting
```

This command takes you through a guided setup:

- First, it asks which driver you want to use (**Pusher** or **Reverb**)

- Then, it continues with additional setup questions (packages, config files, etc.)

- Automatically installs dependencies

- Creates `config/broadcasting.php` and `routes/channels.php`

- Updates your `.env` file with the correct settings

> If you choose **Pusher** as your driver, the installer will prompt you to enter your Pusher app credentials (App ID, Key, Secret, Cluster, etc.) so they can be stored in your `.env` file.

### b. Direct Driver Installation

```bash
php artisan install:broadcasting --reverb
# or
php artisan install:broadcasting --pusher
```

This skips the driver selection step (since you’ve already specified it) but still asks follow-up questions for the rest of the setup.  
Useful if you already know exactly which driver you want.

### c. Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up everything yourself:

1. Install the required driver packages (`pusher/pusher-php-server` or `laravel/reverb`).

2. Manually create the `config/broadcasting.php` file.

3. **Define** your channels in `routes/channels.php`.

4. Configure `.env` settings for your chosen driver.

5. (If using queues) Ensure a queue worker is running.

This approach gives you **full control** and is helpful if you need a highly customized broadcasting setup or are integrating broadcasting into an existing project with its own structure.

## 3. Events

In Laravel, **events** are simple classes used to signal that something has happened in your application — they are not limited to broadcasting. For example, you might dispatch an event after a user registers, an order is shipped, or a post is published.

To make an event **broadcastable**, you implement the `ShouldBroadcast` interface. This tells Laravel to send the event over the configured broadcasting system.

You can create a new event with:

```bash
php artisan make:event TestEvent
```

When implementing `ShouldBroadcast`, it’s **mandatory** to define the `broadcastOn()` method. This method specifies the channel(s) the event will be sent to. Without it, Laravel won’t know where to broadcast your event.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Events;

use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class TestEvent implements ShouldBroadcast
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

    public $message;

    public function __construct($message)
    {
        $this->message = $message;
    }

    /**
     * Define the channel(s) the event should broadcast on.
     */
    public function broadcastOn()
    {
        return new Channel('test-channel');
    }
}
```

### a. Channel Types in broadcastOn()

The `broadcastOn()` method should return **an array of** specific channel **class** instances

```php
public function broadcastOn(): array
{
    return [
        // Public channel - anyone can subscribe
        new Channel('notifications'),

        // Private channel - requires authorization
        new PrivateChannel('user.'.$this->user->id),

        // Presence channel - shows who's listening
        new PresenceChannel('chat.'.$this->roomId),
    ];
}
```

### b. Customizing Broadcast Behavior

#### - Broadcast Name

By default, Laravel uses the event's class name as the broadcast name. Customize it with `broadcastAs()`:

```php
/**
 * The event's broadcast name.
 */
public function broadcastAs(): string
{
    return 'server.created';
}
```

When using custom broadcast names, register frontend listeners with a leading dot:

```javascript
// Frontend listener for custom broadcast name
Echo.private("user.1").listen(".server.created", function (e) {
  // Handle the event
});
```

#### - Broadcast Data

By default, all **public properties** of the event are serialized and broadcast:

```php
class MessageSent implements ShouldBroadcast
{
    public $message;  // This will be broadcast
    private $user;    // This will NOT be broadcast

    // ... rest of class
}
```

For fine-grained control over broadcast data, use `broadcastWith()`:

```php
/**
 * Get the data to broadcast.
 */
public function broadcastWith(): array
{
    return [
        'message_id' => $this->message->id,
        'content' => $this->message->content,
        'user_name' => $this->user->name,
        'timestamp' => now()->toISOString(),
    ];
}
```

#### - Conditional Broadcasting

Use `broadcastWhen()` to broadcast events only when specific conditions are met:

```php
/**
 * Determine if this event should broadcast.
 */
public function broadcastWhen(): bool
{
   return $this->order->total > 100;
}
```

#### - Queue Configuration

Broadcast events are automatically queued using your default queue configuration.

Broadcasting is primarily about notifying _other_ users in real-time. The user who triggered the action gets immediate feedback through the normal HTTP response, while everyone else gets updated through the broadcast system.

Broadcasting events **must** run on queues to prevent blocking your application's response time.

```php
public function sendMessage(Request $request)
{
    $message = Message::create($request->validated());

    // Event is queued immediately, broadcasting happens in background
    event(new MessageSent($message)); // ~1ms to queue

    return response()->json($message); // Immediate response (~6ms total)
}
```

You can specify custom queue connections and names:

```php
class OrderCreated implements ShouldBroadcast
{
    /**
     * The queue connection to use when broadcasting.
     */
    public $connection = 'redis';

    /**
     * The queue name for broadcasting jobs.
     */
    public $queue = 'broadcasts';

    // Alternative: Use method instead of property
    public function broadcastQueue(): string
    {
        return 'high-priority';
    }
}
```

For immediate broadcasting without queuing, implement `ShouldBroadcastNow`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Events;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcastNow;

class CriticalAlert implements ShouldBroadcastNow
{
    // This event will broadcast immediately, not via queue
}
```

> **Important:** Don't forget to run `php artisan queue:work` to process broadcasting jobs - this is required for both Pusher and Reverb to deliver events to subscribers.

#### - Database Transaction

When broadcasting events within database transactions, use `ShouldDispatchAfterCommit` to ensure the broadcast occurs after transaction completion:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Events;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Events\ShouldDispatchAfterCommit;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class UserCreated implements ShouldBroadcast, ShouldDispatchAfterCommit
{
    use SerializesModels;

    // Event will only broadcast after database transaction commits
}
```

This prevents broadcasting events before database changes are actually committed, avoiding race conditions where frontend updates occur before backend data is persisted.

### c. Triggering Broadcast Events

Once your event implements `ShouldBroadcast`, you can trigger it like any other event — Laravel will handle broadcasting automatically.

**Example:**

```php
// In your controller or service
use App\Events\OrderCreated;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

public function store(Request $request)
{
    $order = Order::create($request->validated());

    // Method 1: Using the dispatch() method
    OrderCreated::dispatch($order);

    // Method 2: Using the event() helper
    event(new OrderCreated($order));

    // Method 3: Using the Event facade
    Event::dispatch(new OrderCreated($order));

    // Method 4: Using the broadcast() helper
    broadcast(new OrderCreated($order));

    // Method 5: Broadcasting to everyone EXCEPT the current connection
    broadcast(new OrderCreated($order))->toOthers();

    return response()->json($order);
}
```

**About `toOthers()`**  
`toOthers()` is **only available when using the `broadcast()` helper**.  
It tells Laravel to send the event to **all other subscribers except the one who triggered it**.

This is especially useful in cases like chat apps or collaborative tools, where the triggering client already has the latest data locally and doesn’t need to receive it again.

## 4. Channels

The `routes/channels.php` file serves as the authorization layer for Laravel's broadcasting system. While public channels require no authorization, **private and presence channels** need explicit permission rules to determine which users can subscribe to specific channels.

```php
<?php
// routes/channels.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Broadcast;

// Authorization callback for private channels
Broadcast::channel('channel-name.{parameter}', function ($user, $parameter) {
    // Return true/false or user data for presence channels
});
```

There is 3 types of channels:

### a. Public Channels

Public channels require **no authorization** and do not need entries in `channels.php`. Any client can subscribe to public channels.

```php
// No authorization needed - public channels
// Examples: 'notifications', 'chat', 'updates'
```

### b. Private Channels

Private channels require authorization callbacks that return `true` or `false`:

```php
// routes/channels.php

// User can only access their own private channel
Broadcast::channel('user.{id}', function ($user, $id) {
    return (int) $user->id === (int) $id;
});

// Team members can access team channels
Broadcast::channel('team.{teamId}', function ($user, $teamId) {
    return $user->teams->contains('id', $teamId);
});
```

### c. Presence Channels

Presence channels require authorization callbacks that return **user data arrays** (not boolean values). This data is shared with other channel subscribers:

```php
// routes/channels.php

// Chat room presence channel
Broadcast::channel('chat.{roomId}', function ($user, $roomId) {
    if ($user->canAccessRoom($roomId)) {
        return [
            'id' => $user->id,
            'name' => $user->name,
            'avatar' => $user->avatar_url,
        ];
    }
    // Returning null/false denies access
});
```

### d. Model Binding in Channel Routes

Channel routes support implicit model binding, similar to web routes:

```php
// Using model binding
Broadcast::channel('order.{order}', function ($user, Order $order) {
    return $user->id === $order->user_id;
});

// Equivalent to parameter binding
Broadcast::channel('order.{orderId}', function ($user, $orderId) {
    $order = Order::find($orderId);
    return $user->id === $order->user_id;
});
```

## 5. Frontend Setup with Laravel Echo

**Laravel Echo** is the official JavaScript library that simplifies WebSocket client-side integration in Laravel applications. Echo provides a clean, expressive API for subscribing to channels, listening for events, and handling real-time updates. It works seamlessly with both Pusher and Reverb, abstracting the underlying WebSocket implementation details.

If you used the automated installation commands earlier, Echo and its dependencies should already be installed.

### a. Environment Variables

Add the necessary environment variables to your `.env` file. These will be available in your frontend via Vite:

#### - For Pusher

```ini
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher

PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_APP_KEY=your_app_key
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=your_app_cluster
PUSHER_PORT=443
PUSHER_SCHEME=https

VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"

VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
VITE_PUSHER_HOST="${PUSHER_HOST}"
VITE_PUSHER_PORT="${PUSHER_PORT}"
VITE_PUSHER_SCHEME="${PUSHER_SCHEME}"
```

#### - For Reverb

```ini
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb

REVERB_APP_ID=your_app_id
REVERB_APP_KEY=your_app_key
REVERB_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
REVERB_HOST="localhost"
REVERB_PORT=8080
REVERB_SCHEME=http

VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY="${REVERB_APP_KEY}"
VITE_REVERB_HOST="${REVERB_HOST}"
VITE_REVERB_PORT="${REVERB_PORT}"
VITE_REVERB_SCHEME="${REVERB_SCHEME}"
```

> **Note:** If you use Laravel’s broadcasting installer (`php artisan install:broadcasting`), these values will be generated and filled in for you automatically.

### b. Configuration

Create or update your Echo configuration in your main JavaScript file. The configuration varies depending on whether you're using Pusher or Reverb:

#### - Pusher

```javascript
// resources/js/bootstrap.js
import Echo from "laravel-echo";
import Pusher from "pusher-js";

window.Pusher = Pusher;

window.Echo = new Echo({
  broadcaster: "pusher",
  key: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
  cluster: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
  forceTLS: true,
  enabledTransports: ["ws", "wss"],
});
```

#### - Reverb

```javascript
// resources/js/app.js
import Echo from "laravel-echo";
import Pusher from "pusher-js";

window.Pusher = Pusher;

window.Echo = new Echo({
  broadcaster: "reverb",
  key: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY,
  wsHost: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_HOST,
  wsPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT ?? 80,
  wssPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT ?? 443,
  forceTLS: (import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_SCHEME ?? "https") === "https",
  enabledTransports: ["ws", "wss"],
});
```

### c. Authentication

Laravel Echo automatically handles authentication for private and presence channels by sending a POST request to `/broadcasting/auth` with the current user's session data.

For API-based authentication (using tokens), configure Echo with custom headers:

```javascript
window.Echo = new Echo({
  broadcaster: "pusher",
  key: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
  cluster: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
  forceTLS: true,
  auth: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
    },
  },
});
```

### d. Subscription and Listening

Laravel Echo lets you subscribe to **three types of channels** — each with different use cases.

Remember: **private** and **presence** channels must be defined in `routes/channels.php` for authorization.

#### - Public Channels

No authentication required — anyone can subscribe.

**Frontend (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
// Public channel subscription
window.Echo.channel("test-channel").listen("TestEvent", (event) => {
  console.log("Test Event Received:", event.message);
});
```

_(No backend channel definition needed for public channels.)_

#### - Private Channels

Require authentication and an authorization callback in `routes/channels.php`.

**Backend (`routes/channels.php`)**:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Broadcast;

Broadcast::channel('chat', function ($user) {
    // Authorize all authenticated users for this example
    return true;
});
```

**Frontend (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
// Private channel subscription
window.Echo.private("chat").listen("PrivateMessageSent", (event) => {
  console.log(`Private message from ${event.from}:`, event.message);
});
```

#### - Presence Channels

Like private channels, but also track who is online and share member info.

**Backend (`routes/channels.php`)**:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Broadcast;

Broadcast::channel('presence-chat', function ($user) {
    return [
        'id'   => $user->id,
        'name' => $user->name,
    ];
});
```

**Frontend (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
// Presence channel subscription
window.Echo.join("presence-chat")
  .here((users) => {
    console.log("Currently online:", users);
  })
  .joining((user) => {
    console.log("User joined:", user.name);
  })
  .leaving((user) => {
    console.log("User left:", user.name);
  })
  .listen("MessageSent", (event) => {
    console.log(`${event.from} says:`, event.message);
  });
```

### e. Connection Management and Error Handling

Laravel Echo exposes the underlying WebSocket connection through the `connector` property, allowing you to handle connection events and errors:

```js
// Handle connection errors
window.Echo.connector.pusher.connection.bind("error", function (error) {
  console.error("WebSocket connection error:", error);
  // Show user-friendly error message
});

// Handle successful connections
window.Echo.connector.pusher.connection.bind("connected", function () {
  console.log("WebSocket connected successfully");
});

// Handle disconnections
window.Echo.connector.pusher.connection.bind("disconnected", function () {
  console.log("WebSocket disconnected");
  // Maybe show reconnection status to user
});

// Handle connection state changes
window.Echo.connector.pusher.connection.bind("state_change", function (states) {
  console.log(
    "Connection state changed from",
    states.previous,
    "to",
    states.current
  );
});
```

**Best Practice:** Add these connection handlers in your main JavaScript entry point (like `resources/js/bootstrap.js` or `resources/js/app.js`) immediately after initializing Echo, so they're available throughout your application.

## 6. For APIs

When building API-first applications, you need to configure Laravel Echo on the frontend to send authentication tokens with WebSocket subscription requests: **Frontend Configuration:**

```javascript
window.Echo = new Echo({
  broadcaster: "pusher", // or 'reverb'
  key: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
  cluster: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
  forceTLS: true,
  auth: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("api_token")}`,
      Accept: "application/json",
    },
  },
});
```

**Backend Configuration:**

```php
// In your AppServiceProvider boot method or RouteServiceProvider
Broadcast::routes(['middleware' => ['auth:sanctum']]);
```

This ensures that private and presence channel authorization requests include your API token, allowing Laravel to authenticate users through your API guards rather than web sessions.

### a. Postman Websockets

When working on backend APIs without frontend access, **Postman's WebSocket support** provides an invaluable tool for testing broadcasting authentication and functionality. This is particularly useful for backend developers who need to verify their broadcasting implementation without building a frontend client.

#### Step 1: Establish WebSocket Connection

Create a new WebSocket request in Postman using the Pusher WebSocket URL format:

```url
wss://ws-{{cluster}}.pusher.com/app/{{pusher_app_key}}?protocol=7&client=postman&version=1.0
```

For **Reverb**, use your local server URL:

```url
ws://localhost:8080/app/{{reverb_app_key}}?protocol=7&client=postman&version=1.0
```

Replace:

- `{{cluster}}` with your Pusher cluster (e.g., `eu`, `us2`, `ap1`)
- `{{pusher_app_key}}` and `{{reverb_app_key}}?` with your actual Pusher/Reverb app key from `.env`

Once connected, Postman will receive a connection message containing your unique `socket_id`. Copy this value as you'll need it for authentication:

![postman connection](<postman conection step 1.webp>)

#### Step 2: Authenticate for Private Channels

To subscribe to private channels, you must first obtain an authentication string from your Laravel application. Create a new HTTP POST request in Postman:

**Endpoint:** `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/broadcasting/auth`

**Headers:**

```
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "socket_id": "228710.935060",
  "channel_name": "channel-name"
}
```

![postman authentication](<postman conection step 2.webp>)

#### Step 3: Subscribe to Private Channel

Return to your WebSocket connection and send a subscription message using the authentication string

A successful subscription will return:

![postman subscription](<postman conection step 3.webp>)

#### Step 5: Test Broadcasting Events

With the channel subscription active, trigger your Laravel broadcast event through your application or a test route:

```php
// Test route
Route::get('/test-broadcast', function () {
    broadcast(new TaskCreated(auth()->user(), Task::first()));
    return 'Event broadcasted!';
});
```

### b. CORS Configuration for WebSockets

When your frontend and backend are on different domains, configure CORS for WebSocket authentication endpoints:

```php
// config/cors.php
return [
    'paths' => [
        'api/*',
        'broadcasting/auth', // Add this for WebSocket auth
    ],

    'allowed_methods' => ['*'],

    'allowed_origins' => [
        'http://localhost:3000', // Your frontend URL
        'https://yourdomain.com',
    ],

    'allowed_headers' => ['*'],

    'supports_credentials' => true,
];
```

## 7. Performance and Optimization

Broadcasting in Laravel introduces additional complexity that can impact your application's performance. Understanding these implications early helps you build scalable real-time features from the start.

### Queue Optimization for Broadcasting

Broadcasting events are automatically queued to prevent blocking HTTP responses. However, poor queue configuration can delay real-time updates. Consider dedicating separate queue workers specifically for broadcasting events, with faster processing intervals than regular background jobs.

### Connection Pooling and Scaling

**With Pusher**, scaling is handled automatically, but you pay for concurrent connections. Optimize by subscribing only to necessary channels and unsubscribing when users leave pages or close applications.

**With Reverb**, you control the infrastructure. For high-traffic applications, run multiple Reverb servers with Redis for inter-server communication. Use load balancers to distribute WebSocket connections across servers, but ensure sticky sessions to maintain connection state.

### Memory Usage Considerations

Broadcasting can consume significant memory, especially with large payloads and frequent events. Keep broadcast payloads minimal - send only essential data rather than entire model objects with relationships.

Presence channels consume more memory as they track user information. Monitor memory usage patterns and implement cleanup procedures for stale connections.

### Handling High-Frequency Events

Applications with frequent updates (like live dashboards or real-time trading) require special consideration. Implement server-side throttling to prevent overwhelming clients with updates. Consider batching multiple updates into single broadcast events, or use debouncing techniques to limit broadcast frequency per channel.

### Rate Limiting Broadcasts

Protect your application from broadcast abuse by implementing rate limiting at multiple levels: per-user limits for user-generated events, per-channel limits for high-frequency data, and global limits for system protection. Queue workers should also have reasonable timeout and retry configurations to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor key metrics like queue sizes, broadcast frequency, connection counts, and processing times. Set up alerts for when queues back up or connection counts spike unexpectedly. This early warning system helps you scale resources before performance degrades.

Remember that real-time features are inherently resource-intensive. Plan your infrastructure accordingly and always test under realistic load conditions before deploying to production.
