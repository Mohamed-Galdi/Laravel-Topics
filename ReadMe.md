# Laravel Topics

Welcome to the **Laravel Topics** repository! This repository contains my personal notes and resources related to Laravel, one of the most popular PHP frameworks. The goal is to document key concepts, tips, and practices that I've learned while working with Laravel.

## Table of Contents

1. [Cookies And Sessions](Cookies%20And%20Sessions.md)
2. [Authentication (handwritten)]()
1. [Authorization](Laravel%20Authorization,%20Gates%20and%20Polices.md)
2. [Cache (In Progress)]()

Each section is structured to give a clear overview of the topic and include examples, best practices, and additional resources.

Feel free to explore, and I hope these notes help you with your Laravel development!
